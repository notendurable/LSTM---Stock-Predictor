# LSTM 
Long-Short Term Model to Predict Stock prices over the next 30 days

LSTM is a neural network under the fields of deep learning that analysis and learns from the past patterns and sequences over time to predict the future events. 

Here, I have used Python as a programming language in Jupyter notebook to create a predictive model for stock prices over the next 30 days.
Goal is to know how we can use historical stock data as a foundation to make informed predicitions.
## How it work?
Stock data was pulled from Yahoo Finance, preparing and structuring this data to suit our model's needs. From there I applied an LSTM neural network to capture the sequential data. 
Data Science techniques that was used are - Data Ingestion, Data Preparation, Model Building and Evaluation. 

Stock in prediction here is **NVIDIA - NVDA**
